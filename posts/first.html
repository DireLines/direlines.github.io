  As I'm writing this, I'm drifting through the yawning void between graduating from school and finding a job. The COVID-19 pandemic is also raging on with vaccine distribution still months away at the earliest, so I'm really not doing much of anything these days.
</p>
<p>
  To keep myself from slipping into a nihilistic torpor, I'm filling the gaps in my knowledge left over from an undergraduate degree in computer science. There are incredibly deep and beautiful connections between different areas in CS which introductory courses barely scratch the surface of. I'm pursuing those connections and trying to find explanations with enough depth and breadth to reveal them.
</p>
<p>
  Some courses which I consider to be shining examples of this style of teaching, in increasing order of technicality:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbkdroQ57mNDy204npgel0cqv4_wDInCB">Guthrie Govan - Words of Wisdom</a> (on music theory and improvisation)</li>
  <li><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab">Grant Sanderson - Essence of Linear Algebra</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL150326949691B199">Robert Sapolsky - Human Behavioral Biology</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm3J0oaFux3ZYpFLwwrlv_EHH9wtH6pnX">Ryan O'Donnell - CS Theory Toolkit</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3940DD956CDF0622">Stephen Boyd - Convex Optimization</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPH7f_7ZlzxTi6kS4vCmv4ZKm9u8g5yic">Frederic Schuller - Geometrical Anatomy of Theoretical Physics</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Right now, I'm taking pencil-and-paper notes of Ryan O'Donnell's CS Theory Toolkit lectures. They have been very rewarding and I recommend them to anybody who has taken an undergrad algorithms class and wants <b>More</b>.
</p>
<p>
  More updates on my life: I'm trying out the indie game dev thing; I'm working on a 2D engine for the experience, and have a few Unity projects in the works with my friends from school. But my first priority right now is getting a job so I have my own money and some sort of daily routine. Looking toward the future is literally all I am doing. Quarantines suck, man.
</p>
<p>I'm definitively going through a 90's jungle phase.</p>

  The aesthetic of programming late into the night in the 90s, when everyone was excited about the blossoming internet and Y2K and sharing their awesome CGI mindscapes, is really calling to me. I definitely haven't gone to sleep way later than I intended multiple times listening to this mix and imagining myself working on some sort of unspecified worthwhile code on a CRT monitor.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, now I'm just gonna copy paste the "about this blog" part of the about page and change all the present tense to future tense:
</p>
<p>
  I like computers, and waxing philosophical about them. This blog will mostly be about computers; things I know about them and things I make with them. In particular, I like to talk about elegant algorithms, complexity theory, game development and systems programming.
</p>
<p>
  I am fascinated by, but know less about, deep learning, type theory / formal logics, and distributed systems. As I explore these topics, I'll share resources and explanations that are helpful to me.
</p>
<p>
  But it's a blog, so I can say whatever I want. I'll probably end up talking about music theory, game design, personal philosophy, random topics that pique my interest, and, once in a blue moon, politics.
</p>
<p>
  Hopefully this post has served its purpose as mostly a test of whether my code to autogenerate a list of posts works. Thank you for reading, and I'll have more stuff out soon. Have a good one!
