    I'm a guy who writes code and thinks thoughts, sometimes not in that order.

<p>
    I was born in Charlottesville, Virginia on April 11, 1998 and have lived there ever since. From 2016 to 2020 I studied Computer Science at the University of Virginia. Now I study computer science at home.
</p>
<p>
    I like computers, and waxing philosophical about them. This blog is mostly about computers; things I know about them and things I make with them. In particular, I like to talk about elegant algorithms, complexity theory, game development and systems programming.
</p>
<p>
    I am fascinated by, but know less about, deep learning, type theory / formal logics, and distributed systems. As I explore these topics, I'll share resources and explanations that are helpful to me.
</p>
<p>
    But it's a blog, so I can say whatever I want. I'll probably end up talking about music theory, game design, personal philosophy, random topics that pique my interest, and, once in a blue moon, politics.
</p>
<p>
    I'm looking for work right now. If you see this and could use a code monkey, my resume is linked above.
