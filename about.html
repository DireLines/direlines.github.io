I'm a guy who writes code and thinks thoughts, sometimes not in that order.

I was born in Charlottesville, Virginia on April 11, 1998 and have lived there ever since. From 2016 to 2020 I studied Computer Science at the University of Virginia. Now I study computer science at home, and in my spare time work as a software engineer at Comcast.
</p><p>
I like computers, and waxing philosophical about them. This blog is mostly about computers; things I know about them and things I make with them. In particular, I like to talk about elegant algorithms, complexity theory, game development and systems programming.
</p><p>
I am fascinated by, but know less about, deep learning, type theory / formal logics, and distributed systems. As I explore these topics, I'll share resources and explanations that are helpful to me.
</p><p>
But it's a blog, so I can say whatever I want. I also talk about music theory, game design, personal philosophy, random topics that pique my interest, and, once in a blue moon, politics.
</p><p>
I'm not looking for work right now, but I suspect I will be sometime in the next century. If you need a talented software engineer to help you with a project in sustainable energy, game development or remote education, please don't hesitate to reach out!
